===================

A Symfony project created on August 3, 2016.

I love college football. So I decided to have some fun with friends and family and make a pick'em app. The purpose of the app is simple, to make weekly predictions on who will win. I also keep it up-to-date with the scores and stats so you can see the season averages for each team and game comparisons between teams. Feel free to make an account and play along.
